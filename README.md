Pre-processing and analysis of a dataset that records shark attacks throughout history. The raw file is located in the input folder.

Seeing the data and in order to carry out the task, I present some initial hypotheses to checked and clean the dataset accordingly.

## Hypotheses

- Establish a relationship between the fatality ratio and health expenditure per capita of the country.

- Group these data by legislature to see if changes in government have an effect.

- Check whether opening an Ironhack campus is an effective social and health measure.

## What I've learnt

- The country with the highest death by shark conditional to have been attacked is not the United States, as was intended to be shown.

- It is important to make some good starting points for a more orderly analysis that will help to master the tools.

- In my case, I thought the starting idea was good, but the variables to operate were not the most interesting ones for the dataset cleaning.

- One of the biggest tasks has been to make decisions based on the observations that appeared when processing the data.
